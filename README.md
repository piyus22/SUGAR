### Inti


### Fine tuning lightgbm model1. n_estimators
Definition: Number of boosting rounds (trees).

More trees can capture more complexity but risk overfitting and require more memory/time.

Too few: underfitting.

Too many: overfitting & resource-heavy.

‚è≥ Range Selected: randint(100, 500)
Lower bound 100 ensures it has enough rounds to learn patterns.

Upper bound 500 is conservative ‚Äî LightGBM typically performs well with 100‚Äì500 rounds when using early stopping or good learning rates.

In practice, very large values (like 1000+) are only useful when learning_rate is very small.

2. learning_rate
Definition: Shrinks the contribution of each new tree.

Small learning_rate = slower learning but better generalization.

Large learning_rate = faster learning but higher overfitting risk.

‚öñÔ∏è Range Selected: uniform(0.01, 0.1) ‚Üí values from 0.01 to 0.11
0.01: Common starting point in medical ML; safe and robust.

0.1: Upper limit to avoid too aggressive learning.

Sweet spot: In medical/imbalanced data, lower learning_rate with higher n_estimators often improves generalization and avoids overfitting.

3. max_depth
Definition: Maximum depth of a single decision tree.

Controls the complexity of each tree.

Deeper trees capture more patterns but risk overfitting.

Shallow trees are faster and more regularized.

üìè Range Selected: randint(3, 10)
3: Very shallow, fast, good for preventing overfitting.

10: Reasonable upper bound. Beyond this, trees become too complex and resource-hungry.

For tabular data (especially medical), typical depth: 4‚Äì8 gives best generalization.

4. num_leaves
Definition: Maximum number of leaves in one tree.

More leaves = higher complexity.

LightGBM grows leaf-wise (not level-wise like XGBoost), so num_leaves affects non-linearity and granularity of splits.

üçÉ Range Selected: randint(15, 60)
15: Forces simpler models.

60: Enough for LightGBM to capture non-linear interactions without overfitting.

Rule of thumb: num_leaves < 2^(max_depth) to avoid overfitting.

For example, max_depth=6 ‚Üí 2^6 = 64, so 60 is a reasonable upper limit.

5. min_child_samples
Definition: Minimum number of samples needed to form a leaf.

Controls leaf-wise regularization.

Higher = prevents LightGBM from making overly specific splits.

Similar to min_samples_leaf in other tree-based models.

üë∂ Range Selected: randint(10, 50)
10: Allows more splitting and slightly more complex trees.

50: Regularizes more aggressively.

In imbalanced data: higher values prevent overfitting to small noisy samples of the minority class.

6. subsample
Definition: Row sampling per boosting round (stochastic gradient boosting).

Randomly samples a fraction of rows for each tree.

Helps prevent overfitting and improves generalization.

üß™ Range Selected: uniform(0.6, 0.4) ‚Üí values from 0.6 to 1.0
0.6: Use only 60% of data ‚Üí strong regularization.

1.0: No sampling ‚Üí full data.

Default is 1.0; values like 0.7‚Äì0.9 improve generalization with minimal performance drop.

7. colsample_bytree
Definition: Feature sampling per tree.

Controls the fraction of features to consider at each tree.

Helps reduce overfitting, especially when many correlated features are present.

üß¨ Range Selected: uniform(0.6, 0.4) ‚Üí values from 0.6 to 1.0
0.6: Good if dataset has many features (e.g., after one-hot encoding).

1.0: Use all features.

LightGBM is robust with feature sampling ‚Äî values like 0.8 or 0.9 are often optimal.

üìà Additional Settings (Context)
‚úÖ is_unbalance=True
Automatically adjusts weights to counter class imbalance (instead of manually setting scale_pos_weight).

Great for medical datasets where minority class (e.g., diabetes = 1) is rare.

‚úÖ random_state=42
For reproducibility.

üß† Interview Tips
Here‚Äôs how you might explain this in an interview:

"To efficiently fine-tune LightGBM, I use RandomizedSearchCV with constrained and informed hyperparameter ranges. For instance, I limit num_leaves to avoid overfitting and relate it directly to max_depth. I also regularize with min_child_samples and use subsample and colsample_bytree to prevent overfitting through stochasticity. For imbalanced medical data, I rely on is_unbalance=True to handle class skew. These ranges reflect best practices from empirical studies and are tested to balance performance with memory and compute efficiency."
